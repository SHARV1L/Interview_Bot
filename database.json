SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. As a data analyst, SQL is like your superpower. It allows you to extract, transform, and analyze data from databases, perform complex queries, and gain meaningful insights. So, while ding-dongs are important, mastering SQL is crucial for a data analyst!"
